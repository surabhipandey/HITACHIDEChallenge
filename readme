Preprocessing data
Used geocoder to figure out the exact city of source satation and destination if there is a census data available online we can 
figure out the population/public trasport of the place, which can help in improving the accuracy of the model.
Used one hot encoding for train_name,cource_address,destination_address,source_num,destination_num,current_day,is_weekend,i_weekend_train
Used MinMaxScaler on numeric features.
As train_name is having high cardinality the data becomes very sparse after the preprocession.

Classifier
Tried few classifiers like decision tree/random forest/svm/knn/xgb. As the data is very small(1280 rows) no classifier is working
very well in the sense of accuracy. Most of them overfit. ZEroed down upon xgb as it is really good in capturing non linear relationships
in the data.Scales well in case data becomes large. hey are able to perform automatic feature selection and capture high-order interactions 
without breaking down.
